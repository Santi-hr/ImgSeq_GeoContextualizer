# ImgSeq_GeoContextualizer
Generates an image sequence of maps with the locations from a set of photos with GPS Exif data in order to give them context.
It can use a google location history json for better results. Usually the tracking is better than the GPS Tags.

For best results, during your trip you can use some sports app (Like Endomondo) to increase the rate of geolocation and achieving more resolution.
